<H1> Deep Space </H1>

Deep Space is an umbrella library that runs on top of major data science libraries as <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/"> scikit-learn learn </a> and <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/">statsmodel<a> to site only few.
It is the result of the course I took from MIT Education Professional labeled MIT Advanced Data Science Program.

The purpose of the library is to avoid repetitive tasks, a.k.a DRY (Don'tRepeat Yourself), object oritented, a.k.a.OOP, and Monadic, i.e. using the Monada paradigm borrowed from the courses I took in functional programming - Monads and Classes are quite smilar concepts, tend to solve the same issues in computer science, and here they are used together to solve our main goals.
